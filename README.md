# DesignPatternsFinal

Part A: write a well written, clean code example of one of two Design Patterns. You may implement Proxy or Chain of Responsibility, your choice.

You may use any materials you like to prepare and understand your example, but do not copy and paste code from anywhere, part of the point of this assignment is to do it all yourself.

Make sure your code is well designed, uses separate .hpp and .cpp files, and uses proper software design principles. If you have a base class, it should be in separate files from the derived classes.

Turn in a link to your git repository, and a short description of what you've done and resources you used.
